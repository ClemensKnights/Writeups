On the website for this challenge there is not much to see. You see a picture of a cookie and a background picture of reindeers, both from stock photo sites.
But as the name clearly suggests, this is about cookies, so take a look at the cookies and find two:

	adminpass: MyLittleCookies%21
	cookiez: WlhsS2NGcERTVFpKYWtscFRFTktNR1ZZUW14SmFtOXBXak5XYkdNelVXbG1VVDA5

Since I did not really know what to do with these at first, I looked through the pictures on the stock photos sites, just to click through over 100 pictures of cookies without finding a hint.
After someone told me that you could base64-decode the cookiez-cookie three times and get this JSON structure:

	{"id":"2","type":"guest"}

I changed the type to "admin", encoded it again three times and got presented a new element on the website:

	<h1 mywrongadminpass class='wrong'>You got the admin password wrong :c<br></h1</h1>

I eventually asked milkdrop what the defective </h1 means, but he confirmed that it was a bug.
You could even inject XSS since your admin password would always be injected as an html attribute as seen above.
But this was all just very misleading since the better idea was to look at the challenge description:

	You cannot cmp any cookie with Santa's cookies.

Since most of the challenges were powered by PHP, I did some research on PHP comparison bugs and found horrible stuff about lose comparison and type juggling.
In the official PHP documentation for strcmp http://php.net/manual/de/function.strcmp.php I found a comment (between the many that showed the many bugs of this function) that said the following:

	Vulnerability (in PHP >=5.3) :

	<?php
	if (strcmp($_POST['password'], 'sekret') == 0) {
	    echo "Welcome, authorized user!\n";
	} else {
	    echo "Go away, imposter.\n";
	}
	?>
	
	$ curl -d password[]=wrong http://andersk.scripts.mit.edu/strcmp.php
	Welcome, authorized user!

In PHP if you (by accident or on purpose) compare different types (this is called type juggling) with lose comparison (and not with strict, ===), you can get some pretty unexpected results.
So if you set the adminpass cookie to

	adminpass[]: whatever

The comparison is automatically evaluated to true and you get your flag:
X-MAS{S4n74_L0v35__C00kiesss_And_Juggl1ng!}
