The given file was obviously a reversed mp3 audio file. After reversing, we could hear an electronic voice telling us: 
"Dear CTF player, you have solved .... [some previous challenges] ... but now Santa is taken hostage"
After this welcoming Intro, the voice told us the following three coordinates:

A (511 716 656 388 765 455 430 016 138 955 706 839 007 890 052 532,
  001 622 805 609 316 535 864 254 436 412 730 925 222 158 623 332 074)
 
B (390 390 142 500 834 541 752 332 649 936 545 354 218 395 003 257,
   176 460 719 206 642 987 153 469 086 794 475 382 972 064 519 404)

C (608 097 554 835 704 767 294 367 078 594 102 923 662 585 120 876,
   195 121 033 653 477 539 025 103 641 752 423 493 583 135 321 761)
   
The last information that was given by the voice was to find the point of "complete equilibrium" (which means we have to find the centroid of the triangle)
M = (A+B+C) / 3
Et voil√°: M, having its X and Y parts concatenated and this number reinterpreted as chars, provide us with the flag:
X-MAS{An4ly71c_G30m3try_S4v3d_Chr157m4s}

I know, you think this challenge had to be really easy. Well it was. The only struggle was that the electronic voice was not easy to understand.
